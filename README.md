## 1. Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scraper.git
cd scraper
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Dependencies<a name="dependencies"></a>

The scraper utilizes the following dependencies:

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/): A web testing framework used for automating browser actions.
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/): WebDriver for Chrome, required by Selenium.
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/): A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

Make sure to download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome browser.

## 3. Configuration<a name="configuration"></a>

Before using the scraper, configure the `config.json` file with the appropriate settings. Specify the path to the ChromeDriver executable and other parameters as needed.

```json
{
  "chrome_driver_path": "/path/to/chromedriver",
  "bing_api_key": "your_bing_api_key"
}
```

## 4. Usage<a name="usage"></a>

Run the scraper using the following command:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

The scraper will execute based on the specified configuration.

## 5. Scraping Map Data<a name="scraping-map-data"></a>

To scrape map data, the scraper will navigate to the target website, interact with the map interface, and extract relevant information such as location names, coordinates, and other details. Ensure the website's terms of service allow automated scraping.

## 6. Scraping Bing Data<a name="scraping-bing-data"></a>

The scraper uses the Bing API to perform searches and retrieve search results. Provide a valid Bing API key in the configuration file for this functionality to work. The extracted Bing data may include search results, links, and other relevant information.

## 7. Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting section in the [wiki](https://github.com/your-username/scraper/wiki) for common problems and solutions.
